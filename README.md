## Overview

**Project Title**: Password Manager

**Project Description**: This program is a simple password manager that allows a user to store 
usernames and passwords to an associated website name that they can set.

**Project Goals**: This project aims to help users with keeping track of passwords, which commonly may be difficult to remember.
By having a place to store passwords the user can user more secure passwords since they dont have to worry about the need to remember the password on their own later. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Clone or download the project to your device
2. Open the project in Visual Studio and navigate to the terminal directory of the project
3. Enter "cargo run" into the terminal to build and run the project

Instructions for using the software:

1. Once the project is running it is very easy to use, follow the directions in the menu
2. Use menu options to Add, view, edit, or delete passwords.
3. When you are done select Exit, to close the program

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code
* Latest version of rustup
* "rust-analyzer" in Visual Studio Code

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Rust Programming Language Book]((https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html))
* [Rust in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust)
* Official website: [Rust Programming Language - Getting Started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to add the ability for the program to encrypt and save your passwords on your computer so they arent lost when you exit the program
* [ ] Once the passwords can be saved I'd like to implement a masterpassword. This would be optional but would allow you to protect your saved passwords with a masterpassword that would allow you to access the saved passwords
* [ ] Right now I'm not really the happiest with the way it all looks, and would like to spend some time doing a little bit of playing around with the design of the UI.
